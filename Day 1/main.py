print("Hello world!")

# print() will print whatever you put in the parentheses in the consol.
# Strings are in "", '' works as well
# Strings are not code just text
# If you forget the "" you will get a syntax error.
# Stackoverflow.com is a great way to figure out what your errors mean.
# If you've already used "" you must use '' if it's on the same line.
    # eg. print("print('what to print')")
    # will cause an error if you use "" for both

print("Hello world!\nHello world!")

# \n will allow you to print on next line using the same print function

print("Hello" + " " + "Angela")

# This will print Hello Angela
# using + is called string concaatenation
# This merges two strings together
# You must put " " if you want spaces between the strings or add a space before or after
# Spaces are very important in python
    # Indentation errors will occur if you misplace spaces at the start of a line

print("Hello " + input("What is your name? "))

# Input funciton will let the user input something
# It will pause the program until the user inputs something

print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

# len() will calculate the length or how many characters in a string

name = "Jack"
print(name)

# variables will allow you to name data and save it.

name = "Angela"
print(name)

# you change variables:
    #this will print the more updated version of name

name = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# Make sure your names make sense and will be able to be clear if you come back later.
# When using variables later make sure you spell things correctly and consistantly throughout your code
# You will get a name error if your variable doesn't match something you named before.
